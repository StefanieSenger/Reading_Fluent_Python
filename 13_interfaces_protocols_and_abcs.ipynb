    "Some notes, observations and questions along chapter 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The best approach to understanding a type in Python is knowing the methods it provides—its interface [...]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duck typing: Python’s default approach based on similar methods.\n",
    "- Goose typing: supported by \"abstract base classes\" (ABCs); relies on runtime `isinstance()` checks of objects\n",
    "- Static typing: traditional approach like in C and Java; enforced by external type checkers compliant Type Hints\n",
    "- Static duck typing: supported by subclasses of `typing.Protocol`\n",

    "reference: Luciano Ramalho: Fluent Python. Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming, 2022, chapter 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Kinds of Protocols\n",
    "- a protocol is the methods an object implements in order to belong to a certain class\n",
    "- for instance, a Sequence object needs `__getitem__()` and `__len__()`\n",
    "- but it doesn't need to be a full sequence, depending on what is the purpose of a class and how it is used\n",
    "    - a protocol is like an \"informal interface\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### the two kinds are:\n",
    "1. dynamic typing: duck typing Python always had, defined by convention with informal descriptions (in the Python docs) on what a type needs to implement\n",
    "2. static typing uses `typing.Protocol` to define one or more methods that a class must implement (or inherit) to satisfy a static type checker\n",
    "\n",
    "- static protocols are stricter and can be checked by type checkers, dynamic protocols cannot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Ducks\n",
    "- the ABCs from `collections.abc` can be used to describe how types look like, but the important thing is is that duck typing works without inheritance\n",
    "    - also the built-in sequences like `list`, `str`, etc., do not rely on an ABC at all\n",
    "- an alternative definition of duck typing: \"ignoring an object’s actual type, focusing instead on ensuring that the object implements the method names, signatures, and semantics required for its intended use\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence types\n",
    "- if we would inherit from `collections.abc.Sequence`, we would only need to implement `__len__()` and `__getitem__()` which are abstract classes, and get the other methods (`__iter__()`, `__contains__()`, `__reversed__()`, `index()`, `count()`) by inheritance\n",
    "- `index()`, `count()` are public methods that are supposed to be used by developers\n",
    "- also, the Python interpreter finds ways to iterate over objects that don't implement `__iter__()` and use the **in** operator on objects without `__contains__()` (in case the class was build without inheriting from `collections.abc.Sequence`)\n",
    "    - this is the interpreters own implementation in C\n",
    "    - tries different ways to iterate over anything that remotely resembles a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Monkey Patching: Implementing a Protocol at Runtime\n",
    "- Monkey patching is dynamically changing a module, class, or function at runtime, to add features or fix bugs\n",
    "- FrenchDeck doesn't support shuffling, because it doesn't have its own `shuffle()` method\n",
    "- BUT: it doesn't need it's own `shuffle()` method and the pythonic way would be to use `random.shuffle()` on it:"

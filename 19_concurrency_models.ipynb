    "# 19 Concurrency Models in Python\n",
    "Some notes, observations and questions along chapter 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "- concurrency is the broader term; it can involve parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "- what makes concurrency difficult:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - keeping track of processes and threads: in order to get their return value, we\n",
    "      need to set up some communication channel (messages and queues)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - starting threads and processes is not for free: often this is navigated by making\n",
    "      each thread a \"worker\" that stands by and waits for tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "    - coroutines are cheaper to start, but they are often started by the asynchronous\n",
    "      framework, making them harder to keep track of\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Bit of Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Concurrency\n",
    "- ability to handle multiple tasks, one at a time or in parallel; requires OS scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parallelism\n",
    "- ability to execute multiple computations at the same time; requires multi-core CPU, a\n",
    "  GPU, or several computers in a cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Execution unit\n",
    "- objects that execute code concurrently, each with independent state and call stack; in\n",
    "  Python has three kinds: processes, threads, and coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Process\n",
    "- running instance with its own memory and slice of CPU time\n",
    "- communicate via pipes, sockets, or memory mapped files\n",
    "- Python objects must be serialized (converted) into raw bytes to pass from one process\n",
    "  to another (not every object is serializable)\n",
    "- can spawn subprocesses\n",
    "- OS scheduler schedules all the processes periodically\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Thread\n",
    "- execution unit within a single process\n",
    "- upon start each process uses one single thread: the main thread\n",
    "- threads within a process share the same memory space, which holds Python objects\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coroutine\n",
    "- function that can suspend itself and resume later\n",
    "- *classic coroutines* are built from generator functions, and *native coroutines* are\n",
    "  defined with `async def`\n",
    "- run within a single thread under supervision of an *event loop*\n",
    "- coroutines support cooperative multitasking: each coroutine must explicitly cede\n",
    "  control with the `yield` or `await` keyword so that another may proceed concurrently\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Queue\n",
    "- data structure that lets us put and get items, usually in FIFO order: first in, first\n",
    "  out\n",
    "- allow separate execution units to exchange application data and control messages, such\n",
    "  as error codes and signals to terminate\n",
    "    - Copilot adds: Queues are not strictly necessary for communication between threads,\n",
    "      but highly recommended. While threads share memory and can technically communicate\n",
    "      via shared variables, this creates serious problems: **race conditions**\n",
    "      (unpredictable results when multiple threads read/write the same variable), and\n",
    "      the need for manual lock management around every shared access. Queues solve this\n",
    "      because they are **thread-safe** — they handle all locking internally. Critically,\n",
    "      queues are less about exchanging data objects (which threads can already access)\n",
    "      and more about **coordinating execution and safely signaling state changes**. This\n",
    "      is why `queue.Queue` exists: following the principle \"Don't communicate by sharing\n",
    "      memory; share memory by communicating.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lock\n",
    "- object that execution units can use to synchronize their actions and avoid corrupting\n",
    "  data\n",
    "- if several threads want to write to the same memory address, they need to wait until\n",
    "  they obtain the lock (other threads need to release it first)\n",
    "- for instance mutex (mutual exclusion lock)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Contention\n",
    "- dispute (regulation?) about access to a limited access (like a lock)\n"

    "#### Processes, Threads, and Python's Infamous GIL\n",
    "1. each instance of the Python interpreter is a process; additional processes can be\n",
    "   started with the `multiprocessing` and `concurrent.futures` libraries\n",
    "    - Each spawned process is a completely separate, independent operating\n",
    "      system process with its own CPython interpreter instance, memory space, and GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "      You're correct that they're separate CPython sessions. They're not \"aligned\" with\n",
    "      the main process — they're genuinely separate executables running concurrently or\n",
    "      in parallel. The main process communicates with them via inter-process\n",
    "      communication (IPC) like `multiprocessing.Queue`, pipes, or sockets. On a\n",
    "      multi-core system, these processes can run truly in parallel (unlike threads,\n",
    "      which are GIL-limited). On a single-core system, the OS scheduler time-slices\n",
    "      between them. If you need to distribute processes across machines, you can use\n",
    "      libraries like `multiprocessing` with remote managers or dedicated frameworks like\n",
    "      `dask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the Python interpreter uses a single thread to run the user's program and the memory\n",
    "   garbage collector; but we can start additional threads using the `threading` or the\n",
    "   `concurrent.futures` module\n",
    "    - remark: Really?! I thought garbage collection was done in a different thread or\n",
    "      process; but seems it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. access to object reference counts and other internal interpreter state is controlled\n",
    "   by a lock, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL); Only one Python thread can hold the GIL\n",
    "   at any time; meaning only one thread can execute Python code at any time, regardless\n",
    "   of the number of CPU cores\n",
    "    - GIL is existing in CPython and in PyPy, but not in Jython or in IronPython (but\n",
    "      those two are lagging behind anyways)\n",
    "    - question: Why do they point out write access of different threads to object\n",
    "      reference counts so prominently here? I would imagine that's trivial because it's\n",
    "      only a counter. I Imagine that the write access to living objects is much more\n",
    "      complex and also needs to be protected by locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. the GIL is released every 5 ms by default to prevent any thread to hold it too long\n",
    "\n",
    "5. several build-in functions (for instance those making a syscall) and some numpy and\n",
    "   scipy code can release the GIL, too\n",
    "\n",
    "6. touching with the C part of Python (as numpy does), we can write GIL-free threads\n",
    "\n",
    "7. network programming or programs heavily relying on I/O, will have no efficiency\n",
    "   problem with Python GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "8. contention over the GIL however slows down CPU-intense tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's tools to work around the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "- `threading` module lets us create multiple threads that can release the GIL during I/O operations (like network requests, file reads)\n",
    "- `multiprocessing` module avoids the GIL entirely by using separate processes, each with their own GIL"

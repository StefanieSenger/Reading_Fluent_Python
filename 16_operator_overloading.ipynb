    "# 16 Operator Overloading\n",
    "Some notes, observations and questions along chapter 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "- operator overloading allows user-defined objects to interoperate with infix operators such as `+` and `|`, or unary operators like `-` and `~`\n",
    "- function invocation (`()`), attribute access (`.`), and item access/slicing (`[]`) are also operators that could be overloaded, but it's much more common with infix operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a safety measure, \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Python doesn't allow us to overload `is`, `and`, `or` and `not`\n",
    "    - we cannot create new operators, only overload the existing ones\n",
    "    - we cannot change the meaning of operators for build-in types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unary Operators\n",
    "- `-`, implemented by `__neg__`\n",
    "- `+`, implemented by `__pos__`\n",
    "- `~`, implemented by `__invert__`\n",
    "    - bitwise not, or bitwise inverse of an integer, defined as `~x == -(x+1)`. If $x$ is $2$ then `~x == -3`\n",
    "- `abs()`, implemented by `__abs__`\n",
    "\n",
    "To code this, we take the corresponding special method that only takes `self` as an argument, and stick to the rule of always returning a new object: meaning we do not modify the receiver (self), but create and return a new instance of a suitable type."
